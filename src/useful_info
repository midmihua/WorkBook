# The following logs may be helpful:

    Check the Nginx process logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u nginx
    Check the Nginx access logs by typing: sudo less /var/log/nginx/access.log
    Check the Nginx error logs by typing: sudo less /var/log/nginx/error.log
    Check the Gunicorn application logs by typing: sudo journalctl -u gunicorn

As you update your configuration or application, you will likely need to restart the processes to adjust to your changes.

# If you update your Django application, you can restart the Gunicorn process to pick up the changes by typing:

    sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

# If you change gunicorn systemd service file, reload the daemon and restart the process by typing:

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl restart gunicorn

# If you change the Nginx server block configuration, test the configuration and then Nginx by typing:

    sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
